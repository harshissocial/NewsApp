I created this project following the [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzZEuVaFb9Exi-pc8qtHBrrLg8bUn-TP6) from Land of coding and learnt a lot and next I will be creating my very own application as coding along this project helped a gain understanding of how different components works together, clean architecture and more.
